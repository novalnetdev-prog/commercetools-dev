# Novalnet Payment Connector for commercetools

The **Novalnet Payment Connector** is a commercetools Connect application that integrates the Novalnet Payment Gateway with **commercetools Checkout**. It supports direct and redirect payment methods, authorization and payment flows, guaranteed payment validation, webhook processing, and automatic synchronization of Payments and Orders throughout the payment lifecycle.

The connector is built using the **commercetools Connect Payment SDK** and follows commercetools Connect deployment standards.

* Credit Card 3D Secure support
* Authorization and Payment modes
* Configurable minimum amount for authorization
* Guaranteed payment eligibility validation
* Optional fallback to non-guaranteed payments
* Webhook processing for major payment events
* English and German transaction comments

Each additional method has its own enabler component. Its Novalnet request code is respectively `PIX`, `BOLETO`, `BIZUM`, `BANCOMATPAY`, `KAKAOPAY`, and `NAVERPAY`. Checkout display details for methods treated as custom must be configured in Merchant Center; the localized Payment record name does not configure the Checkout integration label.

## Modules

### Enabler

The **Enabler** provides the frontend integration between commercetools Checkout and Novalnet's secure payment components.

Responsibilities include:

* Loading Novalnet payment libraries.
* Rendering secure payment forms.
* Initializing payment methods.
* Collecting payment data securely.
* Communicating with the Processor.

### Processor

The **Processor** is the backend middleware responsible for:

* Creating payments.
* Calling Novalnet APIs.
* Processing redirect callbacks.
* Handling webhooks.
* Updating commercetools Payments.
* Synchronizing Orders.
* Maintaining transaction history.

## Payment Flow

### Connector overview

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    shopper["Shopper"] --> checkout["commercetools Checkout"]
    checkout --> enabler["Novalnet enabler assets"]
    enabler --> processor["Novalnet processor"]
    processor --> gateway["Novalnet API"]
    processor --> commerce["commercetools Payments"]
    checkout --> orders["commercetools Orders"]
    gateway --> callback["Return and webhook events"]
    callback --> processor
    processor --> orders
```

Checkout creates the Order. The initial `PAYMENT` webhook reconciles its financial state after the Order exists. The return route records redirect success or failure; capture, cancel, credit, and refund events update the relevant transactions. Payment Intent requests call the processor directly for merchant initiated capture, cancel, and refund operations. Order fulfillment state remains with the merchant's order process.

For a gateway decline, the enabler displays the Novalnet reason in its own accessible alert and still invokes Checkout's `onError` callback. Checkout can also show its generic error message. A failed redirect returns to `/checkout` with a short lived `novalnetPaymentError` URL parameter; the enabler displays and removes that parameter when it initializes.

### Direct Payment

Used for payment methods such as Credit Card, SEPA, ACH, Invoice, and Guaranteed payments.

```
Customer
   │
Checkout
   │
Processor
   │

```

### Redirect Payment

Used for payment methods such as PayPal, TWINT, Przelewy24, EPS, Bancontact, and other redirect payment methods.

```

   │
Checkout
   │
Processor
   │

   │
Redirect to Novalnet
   │

   │

   │

   │

   │
Sync Order & Payment States
```

## Authorization Logic

The connector supports both:

* `payment`
* `authorize`

Each payment method can be configured independently.

When **Authorize** is selected, the connector also supports a configurable **minimum amount**.

Example:

| Order Amount | Minimum Amount | Result        |
| ------------ | -------------- | ------------- |
| €50          | €100           | Payment       |
| €120         | €100           | Authorization |

## Guaranteed Payments

Supported methods:

* Guaranteed Invoice
* Guaranteed Direct Debit SEPA

Before processing a guaranteed payment, the connector validates:

* Billing and shipping addresses match.
* Supported European country.
* EUR currency.
* Minimum amount (€99.90).
* Merchant guarantee configuration.
* B2B eligibility (where applicable).

If **Force Non-Guaranteed Payment** is enabled, guaranteed payments automatically fall back to their standard payment methods when guarantee conditions are not met.

## Webhook Processing

The connector processes the following Novalnet webhook events.

| Event               | Action                              |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| PAYMENT             | Initial payment                     |
| TRANSACTION_CAPTURE | Capture                             |
| TRANSACTION_CANCEL  | Cancel                              |
| TRANSACTION_REFUND  | Refund                              |
| CREDIT              | Partial and Full credit             |
| TRANSACTION_UPDATE  | Amount, Due Date and Status updates |
| CHARGEBACK          | Chargeback                          |


## Transaction History

The connector maintains transaction history across:

* Payment Transaction Custom Fields
* Order Custom Fields
* Custom Objects (`nn-private-data`)

This preserves:

* Transaction IDs
* Payment Type
* Capture history
* Refund history
* Credit history
* Chargeback history
* Transaction updates
* Test Mode information

## Configuration

Configuration is managed through **commercetools Connect** using `connect.yaml`.

### commercetools Configuration

Required commercetools settings include:

* Project Key
* Client ID
* Client Secret
* Auth URL
* API URL
* Session URL
* JWKS URL
* JWT Issuer

### Novalnet Configuration

Each payment method also supports its own configuration for:

* Test Mode
* Payment Action

npm install
```

Build the project:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Deployment

The connector is deployed through **commercetools Connect**.

Deployment consists of:

The deployment configuration is defined in `connect.yaml`.

Post-deployment and pre-undeployment tasks are executed automatically using the configured deployment scripts.
